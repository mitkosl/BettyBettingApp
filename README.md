Betty's Betting App


This is a simple beting app for Betty's interview

requitements:

##The problem
Build a console application in .NET Core which mimics the operations of the player
wallet that powers our gaming experience.

##Requirements
The wallet is the heart of the gaming experience and as such, it needs to provide the
following features:
● In the beginning, the player starts with a balance of $0 and after every
operation, their new balance is displayed
● Money deposit - the player must be able to deposit funds
● Money withdrawal - the player must be able to withdraw funds ● Placing bets &
accepting wins - the player must be able to play a simple game that simulates a
real slot game (see game rules below)
● Game rules - our game of chance provides a simple betting experience with the
following rules:
○ The game accepts bets between $1 and $10
○ The game plays out as follows:
■ 50% of the bets lose
■ 40% of the bets win up to x2 the bet amount
■ 10% of the bets win between x2 and x10 the bet amount
○ After every round the player balance is calculated as follows:
{new balance} = {old balance} - {bet amount} + {win amount}
● The game ends when the player decides to leave

##Important note:
All operations that require an amount must include the amount as a positive
number, regardless of the direction of the balance.
